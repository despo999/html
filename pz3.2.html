    <p> <b>Computer programming</b>is the process of designing and building an executable computer program for
      accomplishing a specific computing task. <b>Programming </b>involves tasks such as: analysis, generating
      algorithms, profiling algorithms' accuracy and resource consumption, and the implementation of algorithms in a
      chosen programming language (commonly referred to as coding). The source code of a program is written in one or
      more languages. The purpose of programming is to find a sequence of instructions that will automate the
      performance of a task on a computer, often for solving a given problem. The process of programming thus often
      requires expertise in several different subjects, including knowledge of the application domain, specialized
      algorithms, and formal logic.

    <hr>
    <p>Programmable devices have existed at least as far back as 1206 AD, when the automata of Al-Jazari were
      programmable, via pegs and cams, to play various rhythms and drum patterns; and the 1801 Jacquard loom could
      produce entirely different weaves by changing the "program" - a series of pasteboard cards with holes punched in
      them.</p>
    <p>However, the first computer program is generally dated to 1843, when mathematician Ada Lovelace published an
      algorithm to calculate a sequence of Bernoulli numbers, intended to be carried out by Charles Babbage's Analytical
      Engine. Women would continue to dominate the field of computer programming until the mid 1960s.
    </p>
    <p>In the 1880s Herman Hollerith invented the concept of storing data in machine-readable form. Later a control
      panel (plugboard) added to his 1906 Type I Tabulator allowed it to be programmed for different jobs, and by the
      late 1940s, unit record equipment such as the IBM 602 and IBM 604, were programmed by control panels in a similar
      way; as were the first electronic computers. However, with the concept of the stored-program computers introduced
      in 1949, both programs and data were stored and manipulated in the same way in computer memory.</p>
    <p>Machine code was the language of early programs, written in the instruction set of the particular machine, often
      in binary notation. Assembly languages were soon developed that let the programmer specify instruction in a text
      format, (e.g., ADD X, TOTAL), with abbreviations for each operation code and meaningful names for specifying
      addresses. However, because an
